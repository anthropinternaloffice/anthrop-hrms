# Decisions

Decisions recorded here are settled. They are not decided again. To change one, add a new
entry that supersedes the old one — do not rewrite history.

## D1 — Stack

**Date:** 2026-08-31
**Status:** Fixed by the Module 1 build brief.

React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui, talking directly to Supabase for
database, authentication, and file storage. Deployed on Cloudflare Pages. No separate
backend server in Module 1; one is added in Module 2 for CV parsing and document
generation.

## D2 — `people` is separate from `employments`

**Date:** 2026-08-31
**Status:** Fixed by the Module 1 build brief.

A person is a human being. An employment is a job they hold. Keeping them apart is what
lets a candidate become an employee in a later module without anything being re-typed, and
what lets a former employee be recognised if they reapply.

## D3 — Brand palette and typeface

**Status:** Not yet decided. Set in Task 2, at Gate 1, from the client's live site.

Once approved, the six hex values and the typeface are written here as fixed values and are
never decided again.

## D4 — Attendance policy rules are deliberately not built

**Date:** 2026-08-31
**Status:** Fixed by the Module 1 build brief.

Module 1 builds clock-in, clock-out, the employee's own history, who-is-in-today, and HR
correction with a reason. It does **not** build schedules, lateness rules, grace periods,
overtime, absence rules, or location checking. Every one of those is a policy decision
Anthrop has not yet made; building the rules before the answers exist means building them
twice.
